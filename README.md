# Employee Tracker

## Description

I wanted to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. As a business owner it would be helpful to have an easy way to work with the information in your company database. I wanted the application to allow a business owner to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company so that they can organize and plan their business easier. This content management system (CMS) is a command line application that will manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL2. I learned and practiced the use of prepared statements to handle MySQL queries and how to utilize the strength of asynchronous functions. The ASCII was made using Cfonts. 

## Installation

To install this application and get the development enviroment up and running:

1. Fork and clone the code from the repository provided in the GitHub link.
2. Open the file in your code editor.
3. In the terminal, run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies needed.
4. To invoke the application and enter the database use the command `npm start`.

## Usage

To use this application. Follow the steps for Installation. Run the command `npm start` to start the inquirer prompts. You will be presented with a list of options to choose from. Use the arrow keys and enter to make your selections. If you select "View All Employees" you will be presented with a table that includes all employee's in the company database. If you select "Add Employee" you will be prompted with questions regarding the new employee (first name, last name, department, and manager) and the employee will be added to the database. If you select "Update Employee Job Title" you will be able to update a current employee's job title. If you select "View All Job Titles" you will be presented with a table that includes all of the job title's from the company database. If you select "Add Job Title" you will be able to add a new job title and assign a salary and a department to it. If you select "View All Departments" you will be presented with a table that shows all of the departments from the company database. If you select "Add Department" you will be able to add a new department to the database.
